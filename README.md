<p>This is a raycaster engine built in javascript, it uses <a href = "https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> to run.</p>
<p>In order to run it, you can copy the code in skecth.js and paste it in an empty p5.js project.</p>
<p>This engine is also playable on my <a href = "https://ferdiamt.github.io/Website/raycast.html">website</a>.<p>
<hr>
<p>This project was done in order to get me familiar with raycasting, and how it could be implemented.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn't the most efficient way of rendering 3d scenes and as a result, the game is rather laggy.</p>
<p>I had planned to add more to the game, such as enemys, but even the basic implementation of them made the frames extremely choppy and unreliable.</p>
<p>I plan to remake something like this in C, and use a more efficient rasterizing 3d engine.</p>
